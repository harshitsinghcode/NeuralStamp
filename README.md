# Digital Watermarking Project ðŸ”’

## Introduction
This project implements an advanced digital watermarking system that seamlessly embeds and extracts watermarks from images while maintaining visual quality. By combining Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), along with deep learning-based detection, we provide a robust solution for digital content protection and authentication.

## Key Features
- Dual-transform watermarking using DWT and DCT
- Intelligent watermark detection using a CNN-ViT hybrid model
- Comprehensive attack simulation and robustness testing
- High-accuracy watermark extraction with OCR capabilities
- Performance evaluation using industry-standard metrics (PSNR & SSIM)

## Technical Architecture

### Watermark Embedding Process
1. Color Space Transformation
   - Converts input images to YCrCb color space for optimal processing
   - Separates luminance from chrominance components

2. Transform Domain Processing
   - Applies DWT to decompose the image into frequency sub-bands
   - Utilizes DCT on the LH sub-band for watermark embedding
   - Implements inverse transforms for image reconstruction

### Watermark Detection & Extraction
1. Pre-processing
   - DWT decomposition of suspected watermarked images
   - DCT coefficient analysis for watermark presence

2. Deep Learning Classification
   - Hybrid CNN-ViT architecture for accurate detection
   - Achieves 96.67% classification accuracy
   - Real-time watermark presence verification

## Performance Metrics

## Usage Examples

### Embedding a Watermark
```python
from watermarking import WatermarkEmbedder

embedder = WatermarkEmbedder()
watermarked_img = embedder.embed(
    original_image="input.jpg",
    watermark="logo.png",
    strength=0.4
)
```

### Detecting Watermarks
```python
from models import WatermarkDetector

detector = WatermarkDetector()
is_watermarked = detector.predict("suspicious_image.jpg")
```

## Evaluation Results
The system demonstrates robust performance across various scenarios:
- Maintains high visual quality (PSNR > 40dB)
- Achieves excellent structural similarity (SSIM > 0.95)
- Shows strong resilience against common attacks
- Provides reliable watermark detection (96.67% accuracy)
